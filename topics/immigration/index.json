    "description": "Immigration refers to the movement of people into a country to live or work. It involves legal processes and policies that regulate who can enter, stay, and become a citizen of a country. Immigration can have significant social, economic, and political impacts, including contributions to labor markets, cultural diversity, and demographic changes. In politics, immigration policy debates often focus on issues such as border security, asylum seekers, the rights of undocumented immigrants, and pathways to citizenship. These discussions reflect broader concerns about national identity, economic needs, and human rights."
